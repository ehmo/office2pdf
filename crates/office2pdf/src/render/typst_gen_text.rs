/// **It is an exception list, not a replacement.** The same probe swept Arial,

/// from Word's compressed-line redistribution.
///
/// When `sheet_seat` is `Some` — a spreadsheet cell in a fixed row track,

/// the ascent and descent are each rounded to a whole point and the line is
/// centred in the row's own *track*, or, under bottom alignment, its rounded

/// [`sheet_wrapped_line_advance_pt`] measured pace their *lines* on Excel's

/// TODO(typst 0.14.2 mis-orders RTL glyph ranges without `kern`; report
/// upstream): shaping a right-to-left segment of two or more characters with
/// the feature disabled walks `infos` backwards from index 0 and hands the
/// first glyph the whole segment's text range, leaving the next glyph an
/// inverted one. A debug build trips `assert_glyph_ranges_in_order` in
/// `typst-layout`'s `inline/shaping.rs`; a release build keeps the broken
/// ranges, which are what krilla writes `ActualText` from — krilla 0.6.0 then
/// panics with "byte range starts at 3 but ends at 0", which is how
/// FDO76312.docx failed the bulk gate. Measured on Arabic and Hebrew at two
/// characters and up; a single character, Latin, Hangul, Han, Thai and
/// Devanagari all shape correctly, and every one of them is fine with the
/// feature left on. Word's own kerning rule is therefore honoured everywhere
/// except in documents that shape right-to-left, where it would cost correct
/// text to gain at most a fraction of a point of advance. The defect is
/// upstream's, not ours — per the reference-project rule it belongs in a typst
/// issue with this reproduction, and the exemption here should be removed once
/// a release carries the fix.
///
/// The exemption is a *document*-wide switch rather than a per-run one because
/// bidi reordering is decided over a whole shaped paragraph: the run that
/// loses its glyph order need carry no right-to-left codepoint at all. It is
/// enough that a sibling run does (`مرحبا` between two Latin runs), or that
/// the paragraph's base direction is right-to-left and the run holds two
/// neutral characters — `w:bidi` plus a row of full stops, which is exactly
/// FDO76312.docx. Narrower scopes have to model which emissions end up in one
/// shaped paragraph; this one does not, so no emission site can bypass it.
